                    <div class="ans">
                        Usually, when paying on the Internet through cryptocurrency, the client always receives a new address for payment. Each invoice has a new payment address. That is, if you have 1000 orders per day, 1000 addresses will be generated for you and 1000 addresses will receive payment. In order to collect all payments later in one wallet, you will need to pay 1000 times the commission, even if you put many addresses in one transaction, it will be very expensive. In short, 1000 transactions = 1000 fees (for example, one dollar per transaction). This greatly increases the cost of this payment method. With us, because of the unique technology and therefore the differing amounts per one millionth of a dollar, we collect 1000 payments to one address and only then change it. It turns out savings on commissions by 1000 times.
